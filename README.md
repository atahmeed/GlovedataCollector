* MPU-6050 (1)

## Used Modules
* Tkinter   `For building GUI`
* Serial    `For communication with Arduino`
* Numpy     `For collecting and manipulating arrays`
* Pandas    `For storing data in a file in CSV format`
* The script was converted into exe file using pyinstaller module.

## Instructions
* Main Code : HandDataCollector.py
* Executable: dist/HandDataCollector.exe
